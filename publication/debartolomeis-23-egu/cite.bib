Using time-series measurements of ecosystem fluxes paired with measurements of meteorological variables from a network of globally distributed sites and remotely sensed vegetation indices, we train a recurrent deep neural network (Long-Short-Term Memory, LSTM), a simple deep neural network (DNN), and a mechanistic, theory-based photosynthesis model with the aim to predict ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). We test these models' ability to spatially and temporally generalise across a wide range of environmental conditions. Both neural network models outperform the theory-based model considering leave-site-out cross-validation (LSOCV). The LSTM model performs best and achieves a mean \textlessem\textgreaterR\textless/em\textgreater$^\textrm2$ of 0.78 across sites in the LSOCV and an average \textlessem\textgreaterR\textless/em\textgreater$^\textrm2$ of 0.82 across relatively moist temperate and boreal sites. This suggests that recurrent deep neural networks provide a basis for robust data-driven ecosystem photosynthesis modelling in respective biomes. However, limits to global model upscaling are identified using cross-validation by vegetation types and by continents. In particular, our model performance is weakest at relatively arid sites where unknown vegetation exposure to water limitation limits model reliability.\textless/p\textgreater},
