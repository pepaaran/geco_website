&lt;p&gt;Recent hot and dry summers in Europe have led to impacts on the functioning and structure of forests. Combined heat and drought stress led to wide-spread canopy defoliation (&amp;lsquo;browning&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;early wilting&amp;rsquo;) and tree mortality. The challenge facing multiple stakeholders now is to understand where and when impact thresholds were exceeded in the past years and to anticipate forest responses to future climatic extreme events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth observation data has yielded a wealth of information about the state of vegetation and browning events at a resolution of tens of meters. These data have revealed patterns of a distinct heterogeneity of impacts across space and have yielded information about the timing of impacts over the past decades and effects of repeated stress by droughts in consecutive years. This data-richness, combined with novel machine learning methods, opens a potential for building predictive models, learning from observed impacts and their relationship with environmental drivers. But the combination of temporal and spatial dependencies in the data calls for specifically tailored model architectures, informed by knowledge of ecosystem processes across varying environmental conditions across the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will will develop new solutions to address this challenge. The project will be conducted in collaboration with the IBM AI &amp;amp; Physics for Climate Impact group, based in Rüschlikon, Switzerland, and you work within their cloud computing and data infrastructure. This thesis will set the basis for an online early warning platform that will enable periodically updated near-term drought-impact forecasts beyond the project&amp;rsquo;s lifetime. The prediction target is vegetation greenness, measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). You will proceed by combining multiple data sets for analysis-readiness; developing a suitable method for predicting NDVI time series across space; and developing a reusable workflow and online platform as the basis for an operational near-term impact forecasting and early warning, implemented in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, plants have adapted their stomatal regulation to increase the water-use efficiency (WUE) at the leaf level. Another driver of plant transpiration is foliage surface area, and trends in land surface greenness are thus partly linked by enhanced WUE under elevated CO2. As climate change progresses, it is critical to understand the responses of terrestrial ecosystems and surface-atmosphere exchanges of CO2 and water vapour to global environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to model spatial and seasonal variations in WUE to predict evapotranspiration (ET) within an established global photosynthesis and acclimation model (productivity model or simply P-model; Stocker et al. 2020). The core of this model employs a principle of eco-evolutionary optimality to simulate acclimation of photosynthesis and transpiration based on the trade-off between costs and benefits from water loss and C assimilation. You will use observed root zone moisture storage capacity (SR) to model ET at FLUXNET sites and investigate predictions under progressing droughts. We expect that using the combination of the two key quantities WUE and SR, which are under plant-control and subject to different acclimation and adaptation across the Earth?s climate zones, will improve global ET predictions. It has been demonstrated that rooting zone adapts its extent as a function of the phase lag between peak seasonal radiation and precipitation. Following this framework, we will investigate the effect of a spatially varying rooting depth on the ratio of actual ET over precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis is a great starting point for mechanistic ecosystem modelling and working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere. Basic experience with working with R, Python, Fortran, or other programming languages are a requirement. You may start as soon as you like. Please contact me directly if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to carry out this thesis in teamwork, where the partner thesis would implement a predictive model based on machine-learning instead of a mechanistic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human land use and land use change (LULUC) has transformed the Earth surface and is contributing to the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and climate change. In contrast to fossil fuel combustion, LULUC has potentially been an agent of Earth system transformation already before the Industrial period. Indeed, several prominent features in ice core records of the past 10,000 years have been linked to the rise and collapse of civilizations. However, establishing causal links and understanding the role of pre-industrial human societies in the Earth system has been challenging. Emerging past LULUC reconstructions combine insights from multiple disciplines (Archaeology, Earth system science, Land use Science and Geography) and provide a new basis for simulating impacts with Earth System Models. This is where you step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will use the latest reconstructions of Holocene LULUC from the PAGES Landcover6K working group (&lt;a href=&#34;http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/landcover6k/intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/landcover6k/intro,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://stineb.github.io/holoLU_lc6k/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://stineb.github.io/holoLU_lc6k/index.html&lt;/a&gt;) to run a set of global model simulations for evaluating impacts of pre-industrial LULUC on the terrestrial carbon balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis is a great starting point for working with global Earth system and vegetation models and large spatial datasets, and for linking disciplines. Experience with programming is an advantage and your eagerness to learn a prerequisite. You may start as soon as you like.
